# Popular AI coding agents

Bring whichever one you already have. They all work with this repo as it is: Claude Code
reads [`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md), most others read [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md), and both send the agent to
[`SPEC.md`](../SPEC.md) and [`CONTRACT.yaml`](../CONTRACT.yaml) first.

Whichever agent you pick, type `/superagent` and a few sentences about your app (or paste the starter from [`prompts-starter.md`](prompts-starter.md)). It does the rest.

| Agent | What it is | Cost and free / student access | Start in two lines |
|---|---|---|---|
| **OpenCode** + a free Google AI Studio key — **recommended if you have no paid AI plan** | Terminal agent that reads this repo's `CLAUDE.md`, `SPEC.md`, `CONTRACT.yaml` and skills as they are, and ships with `/plan`, `/decide`, `/build`, `/review`, `/checkin` and `/stuck` commands | **$0, no card.** Google's free tier gives each Gemini model its own daily allowance (checked 10 October 2026: 20 requests a day on each Flash model, 500 on each Flash Lite model; one agent per key). Google may use free-tier prompts to improve its products; check your employer's AI policy. [rate limits](https://aistudio.google.com/rate-limit) | Follow [`opencode.md`](opencode.md): install, get a key at aistudio.google.com, then run `opencode` in your repo and type `/connect`. |
| **Claude Code** (Anthropic) | Terminal agent; also VS Code, JetBrains, desktop and web | Needs a paid Claude plan (Pro $20/mo, or $17/mo billed yearly; Max from $100/mo) or pay-as-you-go API credits. The free Claude plan does not include it. Some universities buy a Claude education plan; ask yours. [pricing](https://claude.com/pricing) | Install: `curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh \| bash` (Windows PowerShell: `irm https://claude.ai/install.ps1 \| iex`). Then `cd` into your repo and run `claude`. |
| **Cursor** | A full code editor (VS Code-based) with a built-in agent | Hobby tier is free; Pro is $20/mo. Its student page says only to watch for campus promotions. We could not confirm a current free-Pro student offer. [pricing](https://cursor.com/pricing), [students](https://cursor.com/students) | Download from cursor.com and open your repo folder. Open the agent panel and point it at `SPEC.md`. |
| **GitHub Copilot** | Extension for VS Code and other editors, plus an agent mode | Free tier $0; Pro $10/mo; Pro+ $39/mo. **Verified students get it free** through the Copilot Student plan (since March 2026), after verifying at [GitHub Education](https://education.github.com/pack), the same verification as the Student Developer Pack. Some premium models are only offered in Auto mode on that plan. [plans](https://github.com/features/copilot/plans), [students](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-on-github/set-up-copilot/enable-copilot/set-up-for-students) | Verify at GitHub Education, then install the GitHub Copilot extension in VS Code. Sign in with GitHub and switch chat to Agent mode. |
| **OpenAI Codex** | Terminal agent (Codex CLI), plus IDE extension and cloud | Comes with ChatGPT plans. OpenAI's pricing page lists Free, Go ($8/mo), Plus ($20/mo) and Pro (from $100/mo), with usage limits that grow with the plan. A "Codex for Students" program is mentioned, but we could not confirm what it offers. [pricing](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/pricing) | `npm install -g @openai/codex` (or `brew install --cask codex`). Run `codex` and choose "Sign in with ChatGPT". |
| **Gemini CLI / Antigravity CLI** (Google) | Terminal agent | **Changed this summer:** for free and Google One users, Gemini CLI was replaced by the Antigravity CLI (`agy`) on 18 June 2026. Gemini CLI still runs with a Gemini API key; Google's docs list 250 requests/day on the free API tier (Flash model only). Third-party reports put Antigravity's free tier at about 20 agent requests a day; we could not confirm that with Google. [Gemini CLI quotas](https://geminicli.com/docs/resources/quota-and-pricing/) | Follow the install steps at [antigravity.google](https://antigravity.google). Run `agy` in your repo and sign in with Google. |

**On a budget?** Use **[OpenCode with a free Google AI Studio key](opencode.md)**: it is the course's
recommended no-budget path, costs nothing, and the guide gets you from nothing to a planned, built and tested
first task in about an hour. Copilot (free for verified students) or Codex on the ChatGPT plan you already have
also cost nothing extra. The tips below matter more than which agent you pick.

**Have a Pro plan?** Plan on the strongest model, then build with a cheaper one. In Claude Code: `/model opus`
to plan, then `/model sonnet` to build with subagents. Step by step, for every agent: [start.md](start.md).

## Steering an agent toward correct statistics on a budget

1. **Spec first, written by the agent.** Describe your app in a few sentences and ask the agent: "Update
   [`SPEC.md`](../SPEC.md)'s FILL IN lines from this description and show me the diff." Read the diff with your
   team before the agent writes code. You do not need to edit `SPEC.md` by hand. Most wasted tokens come
   from the agent guessing what you meant.
2. **One small task per prompt.** "Do H-03 only" beats "build the app". Small tasks are cheap to throw away.
3. **Make it state the method before it codes.** Ask: "In one sentence, which statistic and which formula
   will you use, and why?" Fix the sentence, not the code.
4. **Ask for a test against a known answer.** A textbook example or a hand calculation, plus a degenerate case
   (constant data). See [`stats-first-steering`](../.claude/skills/stats-first-steering/SKILL.md).
5. **Read the diff.** If nobody on the team can explain a number the tool prints, it isn't done.
6. **Keep a data dictionary.** A codebook in `data/README.md` stops the agent inventing column meanings,
   and it earns rubric points.
7. **Start fresh when it loops.** If the agent has failed twice at the same thing, clear the chat, shrink
   the task, and give it the error message plus the SPEC.
8. **Never paste secrets.** No API keys, passwords or deploy credentials in a prompt, file or commit.
9. **Start from a tested prompt.** Copy-paste starter prompts for planning, multiple-choice design decisions
   and building one task, for any agent: [`prompts-starter.md`](prompts-starter.md).
