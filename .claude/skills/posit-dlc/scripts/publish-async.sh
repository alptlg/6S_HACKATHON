# Uses the Connect REST API directly. Deliberately does NOT run rsconnect, so:
#   - the committed manifest is never regenerated from this machine (core/03)
#   - rsconnect-python issue #532 (env key vs --api-key flag) cannot bite
#
# Blocking on Connect's server-side environment restore bills that build to your
# CI minute meter. One repo doing that burned ~1,160 Actions minutes in a month.
# The build belongs on Connect; the waiting does not. See core/04-deploy-verify.md.
#
# Prints no credential. Exits nonzero on a FAILED task; 'detached' is a normal,
# healthy outcome and is reported as itself -- never as success.
